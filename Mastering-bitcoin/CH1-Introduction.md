## what is bitcoin?

***Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem.***

Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin are entirely virtual. There are no physical coins or even digital coins. the bitcoin protocol includes built-in algorithms that regulate the mining function across the network. 

- On average, someone succeeds every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners are competing at any moment.
- The protocol also halves the rate at which new bitcoin are created every 4 years
- Bitcoin is also ***the name of the protocol***, a peer-to-peer network, and a distributed computing innovation.

### Getting started

Bitcoin is a protocol that can be accessed using a client application that speaks the protocol. A "bitcoin wallet" is the most common user interface to the bitcoin system, just like a web browser is the most common user interface for the HTTP protocol.

### Choosing a Bitcoin Wallet

Bitcoin wallets are one of the most actively developed applications in the bitcoin ecosystem.

#### Bitcoin wallets by their degree of autonomy and how they interact with the bitcoin network

- Full-node client

  A full client, or "full node," is a client that stores the entire history of bitcoin transactions, manages user's wallets, and ***can initiate transactions directly on the bitcoin network*** A full node handle all aspects of the protocol and can independently validate the entire blockchain and any transaction

- Lightweight client

  A lightweight client, also known as a simple-payment-verification(SPV) client, connect to bitcoin transaction information, but ***stores the user wallet locally and independently creates, validate,, and transmits transaction,*** Lightweight client ***interact directly with the bitcoin network, without an intermediary.***

- Third-party API client

  ***A third-party API client is one that interacts with bitcoin through a third-party system of application programming interfaces (APIs),*** rather *than by connecting  to the bitcoin network directly.* The wallet may be stored by the user or by third-party servers, but all transactions go through a third party.



### Quick Start

- Bitcoin address start with a 1 or 3. Like email addresses, they can be shared with other bitcoin user who can use them to sen bitcoin directly to your wallet.
