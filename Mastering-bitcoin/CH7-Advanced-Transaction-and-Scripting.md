# CH7 Advanced Transactions and Scripting

## Multisignature

Multisignature scripts set a condition where N public keys are recorded in the script and at least M of those must provide signatures to unlock the funds.

This is also known as an M-of-N scheme, where N is the total number of keys and M is the threshold of signatures required for validation.

***At this time, standard multisignature scripts are limited to at most 15 listed public keys,*** meaning you can do anything from a 1-of-1 to a 15-of-15 multisignature or any combination within that range.

The general form of a locking script setting an ***M-of-N multisignature condition is:***

```
M <Public Key 1> <Public Key 2> ... <Public Key N> N CHECKMULTISIG
```

## Pay-to-Script-Hash(P2SH)

Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) was introduced in 2012 as a powerful new type of transaction that greatly simplifies the use of complex transaction scripts.

***Multisignature scripts are one of the most common uses of bitcoinâ€™s advanced scripting capabilities and are a very powerful feature***
